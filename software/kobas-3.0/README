The new function is run_mulmds, which can run multiple methods of enrichment analysis and give a comprehensive results.

If you have prepared all the package (see docs/install.txt), you can run with this function use these commands:
(for microarray data)
'cd /path/to/kobas_home/; mkdir test/GSE1297; python scripts/run_mulmds.py -e test/GSE1297.exp.txt -p test/GSE1297.phe.txt -t ma -s hsa -i ncbigene -o test/GSE1297/GSE1297. '
(for RNA-Seq data)
'cd /path/to/kobas_home/; mkdir test/TCGA-LUAD; python scripts/run_mulmds.py -e test/TCGA-LUAD.entrezid.raw.counts.txt -p test/TCGA-LUAD.phe.txt -t rseq -s hsa -i ncbigene -o test/TCGA-LUAD/TCGA-LUAD. '

The results is output to test/GSE1297/ or test/TCGA-LUAD/
